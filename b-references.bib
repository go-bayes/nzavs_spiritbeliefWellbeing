              illness, symptoms of potential psychiatric significance,
              substance abuse and psychosocial concerns among patients with
              newly diagnosed lung cancer. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING:
              Kingston Regional Cancer Centre, a tertiary care facility for
              ambulatory cancer patients. PATIENTS: Seventy-one consecutive
              English-speaking patients with recently diagnosed lung cancer
              undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy were asked to
              participate; 52 of the 57 patients who agreed were available for
              evaluation. OUTCOME MEASURES: Current and previous psychiatric
              diagnoses of affective, anxiety and adjustment disorders, and
              alcohol and tobacco abuse; symptoms of sadness, fear, shock,
              anger, denial, acceptance, guilt, suicidal ideation, thoughts of
              death, insomnia, loss of libido, impaired concentration and
              reduced level of work or interest; psychosocial concerns about
              family, work and finances; and an impression of coping. RESULTS:
              At the time of the interview two (4\%) of the patients were found
              to have an affective disorder, none had an anxiety disorder, and
              six (12\%) had an adjustment disorder. Previously, 16 patients
              (31\%) had had an affective or anxiety disorder or both. Two
              (4\%) had had an adjustment disorder following the diagnosis of
              their lung cancer that had resolved before the interview. At some
              point in their lives 24 patients (46\%) had abused alcohol, and 7
              (13\%) were currently abusing alcohol. All had smoked, 33 (63\%)
              having been tobacco dependent. Feelings of sadness were expressed
              by 23 (44\%), fear by 15 (29\%), anger by 2 (4\%), shock by 9
              (17\%) and guilt by 4 (8\%). Seven (13\%) had considered suicide,
              and thoughts of death were reported by 16 (31\%). Twenty (38\%)
              were accepting of their diagnosis, and 5 (10\%) expressed
              optimism. Twenty-seven (52\%) had insomnia, which was reported to
              be severe by 15 (29\%). Loss of libido was reported by 25 (48\%)
              and was severe in 14 (27\%). Difficulty concentrating was
              reported by 10 (19\%) and a reduced ability to work or loss of
              interest by 17 (33\%). Fifteen patients (29\%) were concerned
              about their families and 4 (8\%) about work or finances. Most (41
              [79\%]) had good family support, and 23 (44\%) found support in
              religion. Seven patients (13\%) seemed to be coping poorly.
              CONCLUSIONS: Although psychiatric illness was infrequent,
              symptoms of potential psychiatric significance and psychosocial
              concerns were common in this patient population. Attention to
              these symptoms and concerns should be addressed in a systematic
              and effective way by all health care professionals and agencies
              planning the care of patients with lung cancer.",

  abstract  = "Medicine, Religion, and Health: Where Science and Spirituality
               Meet will be the first title published in the new Templeton
               Science and Religion Series, in which scientists from a wide
               range of fields distill their experience and knowledge into
               brief tours of their respective specialties. In this, the
               series' maiden volume, Dr. Harold G. Koenig provides an overview
               of the relationship between health care and religion that
               manages to be comprehensive yet concise, factual yet
               inspirational, and technical yet easily accessible to
               nonspecialists and general readers. Focusing on the scientific
               basis for integrating spirituality into medicine, Koenig
               carefully summarizes major trends, controversies, and the latest
               research from a wide variety of disciplines and provides
               plausible and compelling theoretical explanations for what has
               thus far emerged in this relatively young field of study.
               Medicine, Religion, and Health begins by defining the principal
               terms and then moves on to a brief history of the role that
               religion has played in medicine before delving into the current
               state of research. Koenig devotes several chapters to exploring
               the outcomes of specific studies in fields such as mental
               health, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. The book
               concludes with a review of the clinical applications that can be
               derived from the research. Koenig also supplies several detailed
               appendices that will aid readers of all levels looking for
               further information. Medicine, Religion, and Health will shed
               new light on important contemporary issues and will whet
               readers' appetites for more information on this fascinating,
               complex, and controversial area of research, clinical activity,
               and popular discussion. It will find a welcome home on the
               bookshelves of students, researchers, clinicians, and other
               health professionals in a variety of disciplines.",

  abstract = "Abstract Spirituality is increasingly being examined as a factor
              in mental health. Recent studies have found that spirituality may
              serve as a psychological and social resource for coping with
              stress. After defining the term spirituality, this paper examines
              some of the research on the relationship between spirituality and
              mental health, focusing on depression, anxiety, and substance
              abuse. While spiritual beliefs often represent powerful sources
              of comfort, hope and meaning, at times they can entangled with
              mental and emotional disorders making it difficult to determine
              whether they are a resource or a liability. Copyright ? 2010 John

  abstract = "Spirituality and religiousness are gaining increasing attention
              as health research variables. However, the particular aspects
              examined vary from study to study, ranging from church attendance
              to religious coping to meaning in life. This frequently results
              in a lack of clarity regarding what is being measured, the
              meaning of the relationships between health variables and
              spirituality, and implications for action. This article describes
              the Daily Spiritual Experience Scale (DSES) and its development,
              reliability, exploratory factor analyses, and preliminary
              construct validity. Normative data from random samples and
              preliminary relationships of health-related data with the DSES
              also are included. Detailed data for the 16-item DSES are
              provided from two studies; a third study provided data on a
              subset of 6 items, and a fourth study was done on the interrater
              reliability of the item subset. A 6-item version was used in the
              General Social Survey because of the need to shorten the measure
              for the survey. A rationale for the conceptual underpinnings and
              item selection is provided, as are suggested pathways for
              linkages to health and well-being. This scale addresses reported
              ordinary experiences of spirituality such as awe, joy that lifts
              one out of the mundane, and a sense of deep inner peace. Studies
              using the DSES may identify ways in which this element of life
              may influence emotion, cognition and behavior, and health or ways
              in which this element may be treated as an outcome in itself, a
              particular component of well-being. The DSES evidenced good
              reliability across several studies with internal consistency
              estimates in the .90s. Preliminary evidence showed that daily
              spiritual experience is related to decreased total alcohol

  abstract = "The relationship between spirituality and various dimensions of
              health and quality of life has been extensively examined during
              the past decade. Though several literature reviews have been
              conducted in an attempt to synthesize research findings
              pertaining to the relationship between spirituality and health, a
              meta-analysis of studies examining spirituality in relation to
              quality of life has not been identified. The present study was
              designed to: (a) determine whether there is empirical support for
              a relationship between spirituality and quality of life, (b)
              provide an estimate of the strength of this relationship, and (c)
              examine potential moderating variables affecting this
              relationship. The research design followed accepted methods for
              quantitative meta-synthesis. Potential moderating effects of
              several methodological differences and sample characteristics
              were examined using meta-analytic approaches with multivariate
              linear regression and analysis of variance. An extensive
              multidisciplinary literature search resulted in 3,040 published
              reports that were manually screened according to pre-established
              selection criteria. Subsequent to the selection process, 62
              primary effect sizes from 51 studies were included in the final
              analysis. A random effects model of the bivariate correlation
              between spirituality and quality of life resulted in a moderate
              effect size (r = 0.34, 95\% CI: 0.28--0.40), thereby providing
              support for the theoretical framework underlying the study
              wherein spirituality was depicted as a unique concept that stands
              in relationship to quality of life. Subsequent regression
              analyses indicated that differences among operational definitions
              of spirituality and quality of life were associated with the
              variability in estimates of the magnitude of the relationship (R2
              = 0.27). Other potential moderators, such as age, gender,
              ethnicity, religious affiliation and sampling method were
              examined but the findings pertaining to these variables were
              inconclusive because of limitations associated with the sample of
              primary studies. The implications of this study are mostly
              theoretical in nature and raise questions about the commonly

               well-being between religious and non-religious people could be
               partially accounted for by differences in rates of charitable
               donation in a New Zealand national probability sample (N =
               5732). Tobit regression models adjusted for the following
               potentially confounding demographic factors: gender differences,
               age, majority ethnic group membership, household income (log),
               education, parental status, relationship status, and political
               orientation. Adjusting for these other factors, the residual
               difference between religious and non-religious people in life
               satisfaction was fully accounted for by corresponding
               differences in the amount a person donates to charity. Given the
               diversity and size of our sample, and our use of strict
               demographic controls, our results are consistent with a model in
               which religious people experience greater life satisfaction
               because they also tend to give more to charity. Our findings
               thus imply that charitable giving, rather than religious
               affiliation per se, is a proximate predictor of life
               satisfaction in New Zealand. This study replicates and extends
               similar models tested in the USA, and shows that increasing
               charity, whether or not one is religious, may be a vital pathway

              politics on subjective well-being (SWB) at the collective level,
              finding that more liberal countries report greater SWB.
              Conversely, psychologists have focused primarily on SWB at the
              individual level and shown that being more conservative
              corresponds in greater SWB. We integrate the theoretical
              foundations of these 2 literatures (e.g., livability and system
              justification theories) to compare and contrast the effects of
              country- and individual-level political orientation on SWB
              simultaneously. Using a panel of 16 West European countries
              representative of 1,134,384 individuals from 1970 to 2002, we
              demonstrated this SWB political paradox: More liberal countries
              and more conservative individuals had higher levels of SWB. More
              important, we explored measurement as a moderator of the
              political orientation-SWB relationship to shed some light on why
              this paradox exists. When orientation is measured in terms of
              enacted values (i.e., what the government actually does),
              liberalism corresponds in higher SWB, but when politics is
              measured in terms of espoused values (i.e., what individuals

  abstract = "Genetic and environmental factors in subjective well-being were
              investigated. Special attention was paid to sex-specific effects.
              A classical twin design was applied, based upon data from 5140
              young adult twins (same and opposite-sex). Structural equation
              modelling was used to estimate effects from additive genes,
              genetic interaction, common environment and non-shared
              environment. The best fitting model involved an additive genetic
              factor and non-shared environment. There were only marginal sex
              differences in mean levels of subjective well-being, and no
              differences in variance. Yet, there were sex differences in the
              degree of heritability (0.54 for women and 0.46 for men).
              Additionally, the correlation between the male and female genetic
              factors was 0.64, suggesting that, in part, different sets of
              genes may influence variation in subjective well-being for men
              and women. A dual mechanism process of genetic influence upon
              well-being is proposed, comprising the notion of interaction
              between genotypes and cultural value systems.",

               answering this question, this book reviews and discusses
               research on the relationship between religion and a variety of
               mental and physical health outcomes, including depression and
               anxiety; heart disease, stroke, and cancer; and health related
               behaviors such as smoking and substance abuse. The authors
               examine the positive and negative effects of religion on health
               throughout the life span, from childhood to old age. Based on
               their findings, they build theoretical models illustrating the
               behavioral, psychological, social, and physiological pathways
               through which religion may influence health. The authors also
               review research on the impact of religious affiliation, belief,
               and practice on the use of health services and compliance with
               medical treatment. In conclusion, they discuss the clinical
               relevance of their findings and make recommendations for future
               research priorities. Offering the first comprehensive
               examination of its topic, this volume is an indispensable
               resource for research scientists, health professionals, public
               policy makers, and anyone interested in the relationship between

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Cancer places many demands on the patient and
              threatens the person's sense of meaning to life. It has been
              shown that cancer patients use their spirituality to cope with
              these experiences. The present literature review summarizes the
              research findings on the relationship between spirituality and
              emotional well-being. Special attention is given to the strength
              of the research findings. METHODS: A literature search was
              performed in Pubmed and Web of Science. Spirituality does not
              necessarily coincide with religiosity. Therefore, studies were
              excluded that focused on religiosity. Forty publications met the
              inclusion criteria: Twenty-seven studies that investigated the
              relationship between spirituality and well-being, and 13
              publications that explored the relationship between meaning in
              life and well-being. RESULTS: The majority of the cross-sectional
              studies (31 of 36) found a positive association between
              spirituality and well-being. The four studies with a longitudinal
              design showed mixed results. The significance of the findings is
              challenged, because most spirituality questionnaires contain
              several items that directly refer to emotional well-being.
              CONCLUSIONS: Despite that the majority of the studies concluded
              that spirituality was associated with higher well-being, no
              definitive conclusions on this relationship can be drawn due to
              major methodological shortcomings of these studies. Longitudinal
              research utilizing spirituality and well-being measures that do
              not overlap in content is recommended.",
