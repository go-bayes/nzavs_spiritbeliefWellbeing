abstract: | 
  Previous research finds an association between spirituality and subjective well-being. However, the widespread use of tautological spirituality scales, poorly defined concepts of spirituality, and heavy reliance on cross-sectional samples cast doubts. Here, we leverage nine waves of panel data from a nationally diverse longitudinal study to systematically test whether having spiritual beliefs leads to growth in personal well-being and life satisfaction ($N$ = 20979, New Zealand, 2010-2018). Contrary to previous research, we find that belief in a spirit or life force predicts lower personal well-being and life-satisfaction. However, in support of previous speculation, beliefs in a spirit or life force predict increasing personal well-being and life satisfaction over time relative to disbelief. These finding are robust after to known demographic influences, and intriguingly, hold among those who believe in a God but disbelieve in a Spirit or Life Force. The recent growth in spiritual beliefs and decline in traditional religion across many industrial societies motivates further causal investigations of the mechanisms by which spiritual beliefs lead to growth in subjective well-being.

The relationship between spirituality and psychological well-being is a matter of enduring fascination [@Ellsworth2010-yu]. Most previous attempts to quantify the relationship between these two domains find a positive association: spirituality predicts well-being [@Russinova2002-rq; @Ginsburg1995-jr; @Zaza2005-ac; @Koenig2010-gk; @Smith2003-re; @Koenig2001-ow]. However, critics have raised three credible challenges.

First, previous research has frequently operationalised spirituality using measures of well-being. For example, The *Daily Spiritual Experience Scale*, which is widely used in spiritual mental health research, includes items such as "I feel thankful for my blessings" and "I feel deep inner peace or harmony" to measure spirituality [@Underwood2002-hg]. These items are used both to measure spirituality and subjective well-being. As Koenig observes, it is unsurprising that spirituality is associated with well-being when the same items are used to measure both constructs. Koenig aptly describes this problematic approach as "tautological" [@Koenig2008-lv]. How pervasive is this problem? A recent systematic-review of spirituality/mental health research found that nearly 45% of previous studies employ tautological scales [@Garssen2016-kb]. The first challenge, then, is to define measures of spirituality that are not well-being measures dressed up in other words. 

A second challenge is to disentangle concepts of spirituality from concepts of religion. The term "spirituality" was first used to describe the religious practices of ascetics and monks, however, more recently, the term has taken on a broader family of meanings [@Swinton2001-vr]. Spirituality and health research does not converge on a unique set of meanings from the wider universe of popular meanings. Although it is commonplace across most areas of psychological science for researchers to explore different operationalisations of focal concepts, the psychology of spirituality has mostly been conducted with cross-sectional North American samples among participants who affiliate with traditional religion [@Ano2005-hx; @Hackney2003-rs; @Sawatzky2005-rw; @Smith2003-re;  @Visser2010-kq; @Yonker2012-zg]. As such, the extent to which the psychology of spirituality and health has repeated or extended the psychology of religion and health remains unclear. Notably, researchers who have operationalised spirituality constructs as distinct from religion constructs have observed a negative association between spirituality and subjective well-being [@King2013-cg]. Thus to infer how spirituality affects subjective well-being, it is important to disentangle the concepts of spirituality from concepts of religion, and to carefully investigate features of constructs in populations where these dimensions overlap, partially overlap, and diverge. 

A third challenge is to investigate the relationship between spirituality and subjective well-being in nationally diverse samples over individual life-spans. Reliable inference requires observing change within people who differ dimensions of spirituality over time, and assessing how their lives turn out [@Garssen2016-km]. Previous investigations of spirituality and well-being, including high-quality reviews and meta-analyses, have relied on cross-sectional samples [@Ano2005-hx; @Hackney2003-rs; @Sawatzky2005-rw; @Smith2003-re; @Visser2010-kq; @Yonker2012-zg]. However, To address the key questions in spirituality psychological health research requires longitudinal investigations. Unfortunately the relevant datasets are rare.

Here, we addresses these three challenges of previous research in the following ways: First, to avoid a tautological elision of "spirituality" and "well-being" we adopt a non-affective measure of spirituality as a "believe in a Spirit or Life Force." On the other side, to measure subjective well-being, we use a well-validated scale for personal well-being and a well-validated scale for Life-Satisfaction (see Method). Second, to disentangle spiritual beliefs from traditional religious beliefs and skeptical beliefs we adopt a four-level categorical indicator combining the binary indicator of belief in a Spirit or Life Force with the binary indicator "Do you believe in some form of a spirit or life force?" The levels of this four-level categorical indicator for spiritual, religious, and skeptical beliefs are as follows: (1) Skeptics: those who neither believe in a God nor believe in a Spirit or Life force; (2) Skeptics about God who nevertheless believe in a Spirit or Life Force; (3) Those who believe in a God but do not believe in a Spirit or Life force; (4) Those who who believe in a both God and a Spirit or Life Force. Clearly such an approach cannot simultaneously address all interests in previous spirituality/well-being research. For example we do not combine our cognitive measure of belief with behavioral measures or attitudinal measures. However, this cost to scope is paid for with benefits to precision. The spiritual indicators measure cognitive states in which distinct varieties of skeptical beliefs, traditional religious beliefs, and non-traditional spirit beliefs are straightforwardly disentangled, and measured within people. Third, to understand how spirit beliefs affect growth, stability, or decline in psychological well-being over time, we leverage longitudinal responses from a nationally diverse probability sample year over nine years (2010 to 2018 New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, NZAVS).  

# Method

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is reviewed every three years by the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee. Our most recent ethics approval statement is as follows: The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study was approved by The University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee on 03-June-2015 until 03-June-2018, and renewed on 05-September-2017 until 03-June-2021. Reference Number: 014889. Our previous ethics approval statement for the 2009-2015 period is: The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study was approved by The University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee on 09-September-2009 until 09-September-2012, and renewed on 17-February-2012 until 09-September-2015. Reference Number: 6171. All participants granted informed written consent and The University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee approved all procedures.

## Sampling Procedure

The NZAVS is an annual, longitudinal national probability sample of registered New Zealand voters, which was started in 2009. The Time 10 wave of the NZAVS contained responses from 47,951 participants (17,981 retained from one or more previous waves and 29,970 new additions from booster sampling and/or unmatched participants or unsolicited opt-ins). Participants who provided an email address were also emailed and invited to complete an online version if they preferred. We offered a prize draw for participation, non-respondents were emailed and phoned multiple times, and all participants were mailed a Season’s Greetings card from the NZAVS research team and informed that they had been automatically entered into a bonus seasonal grocery voucher prize draw. We also mailed our yearly pamphlet summarizing key research findings published during the current wave of the study.

## Participants

The Time 10 (2018) wave of the NZAVS included 47,951 respondents. We analyzed data from participants who responded to our survey at least three times between Time 2 (2010) and Time 10 (2018), resulting in a sample of $N$ = 21,705 ($N$ = 20,979 with complete responses).

### Life Satisfaction
Life satisfaction is a measure of emotional well-being that was assessed using a 2-item version of the Satisfaction With Life Scale, which has previously been shown to correlate with aspects of religiosity [@Diener1985-xy]. Participants rated their agreement with the statements (a) "I am satisfied with my life"; and (b) "In most ways my life is close to ideal." The items were rated on 7-point response options ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. The mean Cronbach’s alpha for this 2-item scale was $\alpha$ = 0.90. Higher scores on this scale indicate higher life satisfaction. Overall scores were means of the 2-items. For detailed information pertaining to means, standard deviations, and missingness, see Table 1.

### Personal well-being 
Personal well-being is a measure of function all well-being that was assessed using a 4-item version of the Australian Unity well-being Index [@Cummins2017-ur]. Participants rated their satisfaction with (a) "Your standard of living"; (b) "Your health"; (c) "Your future security"; (d) "Your personal relationships." Items were rated using a 10-point response option ranging from 1 = completely dissatisfied to 10 = completely satisfied. The mean Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was $\alpha$ = 0.90. Higher scores on this scale indicate higher personal well-being. Overall scores were means of the 4-items. For detailed information pertaining to means, standard deviations, and missingness, see Table 1.

### Belief in a Spirit or a God  
We assess belief in a spirit or a God by asking two non-affective questions: "Do you believe in a spirit or life force" and "Do you believe in a god?" Responses were coded as (1) Skeptics: those who neither believe in a God nor believe in a Spirit or Life force; (2) Skeptics about God who believe in a Spirit or Life Force; (3) Believers in a God who disbelieve in a Spirit or Life force; (4) Believers in a God and Spirit or Life Force. These believe were developed for the NZAVS from the 2005 Eurobarometer. For detailed information pertaining to beliefs, see Table 1.

## Sample Demographics

### Age 
Age was put into units of 10 years and centered at its mean. For detailed information pertaining to yearly means, standard deviations, and missingness, see Table 2.
Gender. Gender was assessed by asking participants if they were "Male" was coded as "1" and "Female" was coded as "0." For detailed information pertaining to yearly responses and missingness, see Table 1.

### Education
Education level was measured using an 11-point rating developed by the New Zealand Qualification Authority known as the New Zealand Qualification Framework (NZQF; 0 = no qualification, 10 = doctoral degree). Education was centered at its mean and standardized. For detailed information pertaining to yearly means, standard deviations, and missingness, see Table 1.

### Deprivation
We measured the socioeconomic status of participants’ immediate (small area) neighborhood using the 2013 New Zealand Deprivation Index, which uses aggregate census information about the residents of small neighborhood-type units to assign a decile-rank index from 1 (most affluent) to 10 (most impoverished) [@Atkinson2014-ex]. The index is based on a Principal Components Analysis of the following nine variables (in weighted order): the proportion of adults who received a means-tested benefit, household income, proportion not owning own home, proportion single-parent families, proportion unemployed, proportion lacking qualifications, proportion household crowding, proportion no telephone access, and proportion no car access. Thus, the index reflects the average level of deprivation for small neighborhood-type units (or small community areas of about 80–90 people each) across the entire country. Our sample had a mean deprivation index of 4.80 (SD = 2.79). Deprivation was centered at its mean and standardized. For detailed information pertaining to yearly means, standard deviations, and missingness, see Table 1.

### Employed
Employment status was assessed by asking participants if they were currently working, "yes" was coded as "1" and "no" was coded as "0." For detailed information pertaining to yearly responses and missingness, see Table 1.

### Partner
Participants were asked if they were in a relationship, "yes" was coded as "1" and no was coded as "0." For detailed information pertaining to yearly responses and missingness, see Table 1.

### Ethnicity
Ethnicity was assessed using four basic categories: (1) New Zealand European/Pakeha, (2) Maori, (3) Pacific Islander, and (4) Asian. For detailed information pertaining to yearly responses and missingness, see Table 1.

### Urban
People were coded as either residing in an urban "1" or rural "0" area based on New Zealand census data. For detailed information pertaining to yearly responses and missingness, see Table 1.

### Political Orientation
To assess political orientation, we asked people to rate their political orientation using seven-point response options (1 = Liberal; 7 = Conservative). Higher values indicate more conservative political beliefs. Political Orientation was standardized and centered at its mean. For detailed information pertaining to means, standard deviations, and missingness, see Table 1.

## Statistical Analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.0.2 R version 3.6.1 (2020-06-22) 2019-07-05). We analyze data from participants who responded to the NZAVS survey at least three times between 2010 (Time 2) and 2018 (Time 10), resulting in a sample of  21,705 (N = 20,979 with complete responses).  To model growth in subjective well-being we use generalized linear mixed models. In our models, we account for the non-linear effects of time within participants by including the interaction of years (a continuous variable) with Beliefs (a four-level categorical indicator). The baseline for this indicator is Skepticism about a Spirit/Life Forces and Skepticism about a God. To handle the dependencies introduced from the repeated measures, we include individual ID as an effect modeled as random, and estimated a random effect for the slope for years. The model equations are given below and priors are given below.   


## Potential Confounders and Missing Data 
Because missing values can result in biased estimates [@Blackwell2017-oq], we multiply imputed 10 datasets using the AmeliaII package in R[@Honaker2011-yu].We conducted a parallel analysis averaging over the multiply imputed datasets, without any substantive difference to inferences. Additionally the results were robust to filtering of participants of N > 3 to N = 8 waves. In a supplemental analysis we include standard demographic indicators used in New Zealand Attitudes and Values Research: [NZAVS modelling standards](https://cdn.auckland.ac.nz/assets/psych/about/our-research/nzavs/NZAVSTechnicalDocuments/NZAVS-Technical-Documents-e11-Default-Statistical-Standards.pdf). We centered and scaled the education, deprivation, and political conservativism. We centred age was centred at and put into decade-long intervals. There are increasing worries 


We provide the analyses of these additional analyses in the supplement.  The supplement describing these analysis is located at: https://github.com/jacopastorius/nzavs_spiritbeliefWellbeing.

## Personal Well-Being
We fitted a linear mixed effects model using the brms package [@BRMSpackage] in R [@R-base] to predict personal well-being (PWI) with years (0-9), beliefs (four categories), with Id as random intercept and years as a random slope effect (see below: model equations). 

Within this model:

  - The effect of years is positive is reliable (posterior median = 0.025, HDI [0.020, 0.031] pd = 100.00%).  We infer that personal well-being increased in the skeptic population between 2010 and 2018.
  - The effect of beliefs in *Spirit Excludes God*  is reliably negative (posterior median = -0.058, HDI [-0.080, -0.035], pd = 100.00%). We infer that the population that believed in a Spirit but did not believe in a God was lower in personal well-being at the intercept compared to skeptics.
  - The effect of beliefs in *God And Spirit*  is reliably negative (posterior median = -0.064, HDI [-0.091, -0.037], pd = 100.00%). We infer that the population that believed in a God and a Spirit or Life Force was lower in personal well-being at the intercept compared to skeptics.
  - The effect of beliefs in *God Excludes Spirit*  is not reliable (posterior median = -0.002 HDI [-0.039,  0.033], pd = 53.50%). We infer that the population that believed in a God and doubted a Spirit or Life Force were similar were similar in personal well-being at the intercept to skeptics.

## Personal Well-Being: years X beliefs

```

The effect of years $\times$ belief in a *Spirit Excludes God*  is reliably positive  (posterior median = 0.010, HDI [ 0.003,  0.017], pd = 99.02%). We infer that people with beliefs in a spirit or life force who do not believe in a God tended to grow in their personal well-being over time at a faster rate than skeptics grew.
  - The effect of years $\times$ in *God And Spirit*  is reliably positive  (posterior median = 0.014, HDI [0.008, 0.021], pd = 99.98%). We infer that people who believe in a spirit or life force who also believe in a God tended to grow in their personal well-being over time at a faster rate than skeptics grew.
  - The effect of years $\times$ belief in *God Excludes Spirit*  is not reliable (posterior median = 0.002, HDI [-0.009,  0.015], pd =  63.73%).  We infer that people who believe in a God but not a spirit or life force did not grow at a faster rate in personal well-being than skeptics grew.
  
## Life Satisfaction

We fitted a linear mixed effects model using the brms package [@BRMSpackage] in R [@R-base] to predict personal well-being (PWI) with years (0-9), beliefs (four categories), with Id as random intercept and years as a random slope effect (see model equations, below).

Within this model: 

  - The effect of years is positive is reliable (posterior median =  0.014, HDI [ 0.010, 0.019], pd = 100.00%).  We infer that life satisfaction increased in the skeptic population between 2010 and 2018.
  -The effect of beliefs in *Spirit Excludes God*  is reliably positive (posterior median =   0.018, HDI [ 0.001, 0.035], pd = 96.05%). We infer that the population that believed in a Spirit but did not believe in a God was higher in life satisfaction at the intercept compared with skeptics.
  - The effect of beliefs in *God And Spirit*  is reliably positive (posterior median = 0.051, HDI [ 0.031, 0.071], pd = 100.00%). We infer that the population that believed in a God and a Spirit or Life Force was higher in life satisfaction at the intercept compared with skeptics.
  - The effect of beliefs in *God Excludes Spirit*  is reliably positive (posterior median =  0.076, HDI [ 0.048, 0.102], pd = 100.00%). We infer that the population that believed in a God and doubted a Spirit or Life Force  was higher in life satisfaction at the intercept compared with skeptics.

  - The interaction of years $\times$ beliefs in *Spirit Excludes God* is reliably positive (posterior median = 0.012, HDI [ 0.007, 0.017], pd = 100.00%). We infer that people with beliefs in a Spirit or Life Force who do not believe in a God tended to grow over time in their life satisfaction at a faster rate than skeptics.

We infer that people who believe in a God but not a spirit or life force tended to grow over time in their life satisfaction at a similar rate to skeptics.

# Discussion

The purpose of this study has been to clarify the relationship between belief in a spirit/life force and subjective well-being, addressing three challenges from previous research: (1) tautological measures of spirituality and subjective well-being; (2) insufficiently distinct measures of spirituality and religion; (3) cross-sectional samples. Here, we ask whether beliefs in a Spirit or Life Force predict growth in personal well-being and life-satisfaction over 9 waves (8 years) in nationally diverse western populations who differ in the dimensions of spiritual and religious beliefs. We observe that:

1. At the outset of the study, in 2010, the expected subjective well-being as measured using the personal well-being Inventory was expected to be lower among those who believed in Spirit or Life Force but not a God ($\hat{y} =$  6.80 [6.76, 6.85]) and lower among those who believed in both a Spirit/Life-Force and a God ($\hat{y}$ =  6.78 [6.74, 6.81]) in comparison both to the skeptical population who neither believed in a God nor a life force ($\hat{y}$ = 6.92 [6.87, 6.96]) and to the population that believed in a God but was skeptical about belief in a Spirit or Life Force ($\hat{y}$ 6.90 [6.83, 6.98]). (See Figure 2)  Similarly,the expected subjective well-being as measured using the life satisfaction Inventory was lowest in 2010 among those who believed in Spirit or Life Force but not a God ($\hat{y}$ = 5.07 [5.04, 5.10]). Life satisfaction was similar among those who believed in both a Spirit/Life-Force and a God  ($\hat{y}$ =  5.11 [5.08, 5.13]) in comparison both with the skeptical population who neither believed in a God nor a life force ($\hat{y}$ = 5.12 [5.08, 5.15]). Life satisfaction was highest among the population that believed in a God but was skeptical about belief in a Spirit or Life Force ($\hat{y}$ 5.19 [5.14, 5.25]) (see Figure 3)

2. However, over time, belief in a Spirit or Life Force predicts a trajectory of growth in personal well-being. In 2018, personal well-being among who believe in Spirit or Life Force but not a God had grown to ($\hat{y} =  7.12$ [7.09, 7.16], $\Delta \hat{y} = 0.32$). Among those who believed in both a Spirit/Life-Force and a God, personal well-being had grown to ($\hat{y} =  7.13$ [7.10, 7.16], $\Delta \hat{y} = 0.35$). By contrast, personal well-being among the skeptical population who neither believed in a God nor a Life Force grew less steeply across the eight year interval $\hat{y} = 7.14$ [7.11, 7.18], $\Delta \hat{y} = 0.22$). By the same token, personal well-being among those who believe in a God but are skeptical about a Spirit/Life Force grew less steeply $\hat{y} = 7.15$, [7.09, 7.21] $\Delta \hat{y} = 0.25$). Similarly, over time, belief in a Spirit or Life Force predicts a trajectory of growth in life satisfaction. In 2018, the expected effect of spiritual beliefs on life satisfaction among those who believe in Spirit or Life Force but not a God had grown to ($\hat{y} =  5.31$ [5.28, 5.33], $\Delta \hat{y} = 0.23$). In practical terms, such growth is equivalent to the expected gain in life satisfaction from being employed and a sixth as large as the expected benefit to life satisfaction from having a romantic partner. In practical terms, the rate of increase in personal wellbeing among those with Spirit/Life force beliefs was about one and half times greater than it was among those who lacked such beliefs (See Figure 2). Among those who believed in both a Spirit/Life-Force and a God, life satisfaction had grown to ($\hat{y} = 5.33 [5.31, 5.35]$, $\Delta \hat{y} = 0.24$). By contrast, life satisfaction among the skeptical population who neither believed in a God nor a Life Force lagged behind over the eight year interval $\hat{y} =  5.24 [5.21, 5.27], \Delta \hat{y} = 0.13$). Relatedly, life satisfaction in the population that believe in God but are skeptical about a Spirit/Life Force grew less steeply $\hat{y} =  5.31 [5.26, 5.36], \Delta \hat{y} = 0.11$). In practical terms, the rate of increase in life satisfaction among those with Spirit/Life force beliefs was twice as large (See Figure 3).

3. Inferred growth from spiritual beliefs is evident from 9 annual waves of data collection (8 years), and across a nationally diverse sample. On this basis of this longitudinal information accumulated across nationally, we are confident that growth in personal well-being and in life-satisfaction among those who believe in a Spirit and Life force are evident. Such effects co-occur in people who lack a belief in a God as well as among people who believe in a God as well as a Spirit or Life force. 

## Key Questions

Two fundamental question arise from the patterns we observe in this study. The first question is why those who believed in Spirit or Life Force were initially lower in their personal well-being and life-satisfaction in the initial years of this study in comparison to religious and non-religious skeptics? During the early years of New Zealand Attitudes and Values data collection New Zealand was emerging from the twin impacts of a global financial recession and a series of devastating earthquakes that destroyed 30% of Christchurch, New Zealand's second largest city [@greaves2015regional]. Orthogonal research observes that economic and ecological distress are associated with increases in traditional religious beliefs [@sibley2012faith]. Experimental research has found among religious people death anxiety provokes acceptance of non-traditional religious beliefs [@norenzayan2006belief]. Because spiritual belief items were only introduced during the year of the earthquakes, we cannot here resolve whether the shifting relationship between spirit beliefs and well-being were the result of demand for spiritual beliefs among those secular and religious people who were adversely affected by the financial crisis or natural disaster. On the other hand, such exogenous influences might have adversely affected those with Spirit/Life force beliefs in the early phases of this study, and the patterns observed here are better understood as a regression to a population mean. Though beyond the scope of this study, how subjective well-being changes in response to changes in spiritual beliefs, as well as special sensitivities to distress among people with spiritual beliefs are important questions for future investigations. Despite the longitudinal quality of this study, a causal explanation remains elusive. 

Second, our task here has been to clarify whether beliefs predict growth in well-being. However, as we have indicated at the outset, the term "spirituality" applies to a family of concepts. We have not attempted to model the diverse philosophical, social, and behavioral attributes within people who adhere to spirit beliefs. Moreover, people might identify as spiritual without having any accompanying belief in a Spirit or Life force. The task of clarifying how distinct features across a diverse family of "spirituality" concepts affect perceptions of individual well-being remain intriguing horizons. 

## Importance
Despite its limitations, our study is important both for its methods and its findings. We demonstrate that spirituality can be operationalised to avoid the pitfalls of tautology evident in previous research by focusing on states of beliefs, that concepts of such belief states can be refined to enable distinctions necessary to investigate spirituality in mixed secular and religious populations, and that the question of whether beliefs states predict growth in subjective well-being can be investigated in a longitudinal setting. Our finding that, indeed, spiritual beliefs predict growth in perceived well-being and life satisfaction may hold practical importance. Previous research indicates that religious beliefs are associated with psychological well-being [@Smith2003-re]. Western populations are increasingly identifying as "spiritual but not religious" [@Zinnbauer2005-vz; @Swinton2001-vr]. Here, we observe that even among people who lack a traditional religious belief in God, believing in a Spirit or Life force predicts incremental improvements in well-being that sum to practically large effects. Though the contextual and psychological mechanisms that underpin such growth will require many decades of research, this preliminary finding is good news for those increasing numbers of individuals continue to report spiritual beliefs but who do not affirm traditional religious beliefs.
